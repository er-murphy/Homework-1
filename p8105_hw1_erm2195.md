# Problem 1

## Loading the Library and Dataset

Load the `moderndive` and `tidyverse` libraries (for scatterplot later):

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

Load the `early_january_weather` dataset:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Describing the Dataset

Get an overview of the dataset (although str(‘df’) displays the number
of rows and columns in the dataframe, also using nrow and ncol as
directed):

``` r
str(early_january_weather)
```

    ## tibble [358 × 15] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ origin    : chr [1:358] "EWR" "EWR" "EWR" "EWR" ...
    ##  $ year      : int [1:358] 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 ...

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

This dataset describes the weather in the first two weeks of January
2013. It contains 358 observations (rows) and has 15 variables
(columns), including temperature, humidity, and visibility.

Find the mean temperature:

``` r
mean(pull(early_january_weather, var = temp))
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

The mean temperature is approximately 40 degrees F.

## Making a Scatterplot

Make a scatterplot of time_hour(x) vs. temp(y), with the points colored
by humidity:

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_erm2195_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The plot depicts temperatures generally trending upwards throughout the
first two weeks of January, until a sudden cold spell mid-month.
Humidity varies throughout the month, but is noticeably higher when
temperatures sit above the low 40s. Daily cycles from the high temp in
the middle of the day to the low at night are also clear.

Exporting the scatterplot to the project directory:

``` r
ggsave("TempvsTime.png")
```

# Problem 2

## Creating a Data Frame

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
    vec_random = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = vec_random > 0,
    vec_char = c("Hoyt", "Bond", "Atlantic", "Smith", "Remsen", "Court", "Pacific", "Boerum", "Livingston", "Fulton"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Street", "Street", "Avenue", "Street", "Place", "Street", "Avenue", "Place", "Avenue", "Street"))
)
```

View the resulting data frame:

``` r
problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_random vec_logical vec_char   vec_factor
    ##         <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>      <fct>     
    ##  1    -1.33   FALSE       Hoyt       Street    
    ##  2     0.0227 TRUE        Bond       Street    
    ##  3     0.0115 TRUE        Atlantic   Avenue    
    ##  4     1.18   TRUE        Smith      Street    
    ##  5     0.808  TRUE        Remsen     Place     
    ##  6    -0.500  FALSE       Court      Street    
    ##  7     0.454  TRUE        Pacific    Avenue    
    ##  8     0.857  TRUE        Boerum     Place     
    ##  9    -0.552  FALSE       Livingston Avenue    
    ## 10     1.40   TRUE        Fulton     Street

## Calculating Means

Take the mean of each variable in the dataframe:

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_random))
```

    ## [1] 0.2350822

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I am able to determine that the mean value of the random sample and
logical vectors, but trying to take the mean of the character and factor
vectors doesn’t work.

## Calculating Means Attempt 2: Converting Variables

Attempt to convert the logical, character, and factor vectors into
numeric variables:

``` r
vec_logical_num = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_logical))
vec_char_num = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_char))
vec_factor_num = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, var = vec_factor))
```

As a result, the logical vector now has values of 1 and 0, with 1
corresponding to previous True values and 0 corresponding to previous
False values. This is how a mean of the logical vector was calculated
before, by just finding the average of the 10 values of 1s and 0s.

The character vector just has 10 values of NA, as the strings previously
present didn’t contain any actual numbers. This explains why we weren’t
able to calculate a mean for this vector, as it contains no values that
R can interpret numerically.

Finally, the factor vector turns into a vector of 1, 2, and 3, with each
corresponding to the factor “level” of the item at that position
previously. For example, the Street “level” became 3. I presume that we
can’t get the mean of the factor vector because the 1,2,and 3 values are
just assigned to represent true categories behind the scenes.
